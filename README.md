# Stock Price Prediction for 2026 ðŸ“ˆ

This project uses historical stock price data to build a regression model that predicts the stock's closing price for the year 2026 using **Linear Regression**.

## ðŸ§  Project Goal
To predict the future stock price (Close) for a full year (2026) based on past data.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Steps
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler
- Linear Regression model building
- Evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ²
- Forecasting future prices for 2026
- Visualization of the results

## ðŸ“Š Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- sklearn-learn

## ðŸ“Œ Model Performance
The model was evaluated using the test set and achieved:
- RÂ² score , MAE, MSE, RMSE â€” all calculated

## ðŸ“Ž Project Notebook
See the Colab notebook in this repository for full code and explanations.
